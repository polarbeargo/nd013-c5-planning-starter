### Project: Motion Planning and Decision Making for Autonomous Vehicles  
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)  

This repository contains the starter code to launch in the SDC Planning course workspace. 

In this project, we will implement two of the main components of a traditional hierarchical planner:  
- The Behavior Planner  
- The Motion Planner  

To be able to:

- Avoid static objects (cars, bicycles and trucks) parked on the side of the road (but still invading the lane). The vehicle must avoid crashing with these vehicles by executing either a “nudge” or a “lane change” maneuver.  
- Handle any type of intersection (3-way, 4-way intersections and roundabouts) by STOPPING in all of them (by default)  
- Track the centerline on the traveling lane.  

Using the CARLA simulator to verify our result.  

### Result:
